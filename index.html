<p>
Apart from writing articles I also write poetry and short stories.
</p>
<p> I think of my poetry the same way I think of my journalism: as non-fiction. In my poetry, I strive for emotional clarity. I write about family, politics, China, sex, gender, and growing up disjointedly in several cultures.</p>
<p> I was one of the six London Laureates selected by <a href="https://www.spreadtheword.org.uk/projects/young-peoples-laureate/">Spread the Word</a> from 2015-16. I was a member of the <a href="https://www.barbican.org.uk/take-part/young-creatives/young-poets">Barbican Young Poets</a> from 2014-15. I cut my teeth with the <a href="http://www.writingsquad.com/">Yorkshire Writing Squad</a> from 2007-11, and still feel like all of my poetry originates in a way from some classroom in Sheffield.

<h2 id="doing">doing</h2>

<p>From May 2018 I've worked to advance media freedoms as an officer on the board of the <a href="http://www.fccchina.org/"> Foreign Correspondents' Club of China</a>.</p>

<p>In a past life I was an economist and a campaigner. I co-founded <a href="https://www.rethinkeconomics.org/"> Rethinking Economics</a>, a UK-headquartered charity that campaigns for more diverse economics education in universities worldwide.
</p>
<h2 id="speaking">speaking</h2>
<p>If you prefer audio to text, I take part fairly regularly in the BBC World Service's hour-long Business Matters show, which is a breakfast show (if you're in China) or a late night show (if you're in the UK). Here's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w172wmws9zrcks9">one episode</a> in which I discuss Iran sanctions and peaceful protest.</p>
<p>I'm happy to come talk at your school, non-profit or conference if you think I'd be a good fit and it's for a good cause: email me.</p>
You can hear me talk about the Rethinking Economics campaign on the New Economics Foundation's <a href="https://soundcloud.com/weeklyeconomicspodcast/rethinkingeconomics">Weekly Economics Podcast</a>. You can also listen to me discuss Rethinking Economics on BBC Radio 4 with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04svjbj">Aditya Chakrabortty</a>, and again with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b074zgr2">Peter Day</a>.
